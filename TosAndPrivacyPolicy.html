        <h3>3. DESCRIPTION OF THE PLATFORM</h3>
        <p>
          Flickzit is an educational platform designed to support
          users in learning and enhancing various physical skills and
          techniques, with a core focus on gymnastics. The platform
          offers a range of content, allowing users to view skill
          elements, select their proficiency level, and access a
          variety of drills and exercises. Our goal is to provide a
          personalized, safe, and engaging learning experience,
          empowering users to progress at their own pace across an
          expanding collection of activities. As Flickzit evolves, new
          drills and skill-building content will be introduced,
          creating a dynamic resource for users interested in physical
          and technical skill development.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h3>4. ACCOUNT</h3>
        <p>
          To register on the Flickzit platform as a user, you must
          fill out the registration form available on the platform,
          provide an email address and create a password or you can
          register and log in through your Google account. You are
          responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your
          password and account information, and are fully responsible
          for all activities that occur under your password or
          account.
        </p>
        <p>You agree to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            (a) Immediately notify Flickzit of any unauthorized use of
            your password or account or any other breach of security.
          </li>
          <li>
            (b) Ensure that you log out of your account at the end of
            each session.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You may never use another user's account without Flickzit's
          prior authorization. Flickzit will not be liable for any
          loss or damage arising from your breach of this agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
          Users may cancel their accounts at any time and for any
          reason through the account settings or by sending us their
          request through our contact information. Such cancellation
          will only result in the deletion of the account and the
          deletion of all personal data provided to Flickzit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Flickzit reserves the right to terminate your account or
          your access immediately, with or without notice, and without
          liability to you, if Flickzit believes that you have
          violated any provision of these terms and conditions.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h3>5. SUBSCRIPTIONS</h3>
        <p>
          Flickzit offers a single monthly subscription level, which
          provides full access to all content available on the
          platform. Although there is a small amount of free content,
          this is very limited, and full access is only available to
          subscribers. By purchasing a subscription, the user agrees
          that the subscription automatically renews each month.
          Renewals are automatically billed and charged using the
          payment method provided during registration, such as credit
          card, debit card or other payment methods supported by
          Apple's App Store. Flickzit does not handle payments
          directly; they are processed through Apple's App Store using
          RevenueCat as a subscription management intermediary.
        </p>
        <p>
          Users have the option to cancel their subscription at any
          time from their account. Once cancelled, the subscription
          will remain active until the next billing date, at which
          time access to subscriber-only content will be revoked. The
          cancellation process and payment management is also done
          through Apple's App Store, where users can review their
          subscription status, payment method and other pertinent
          details.
        </p>

        <h3>6. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
        <p>
          Flickzit provides educational content and fitness-related
          exercises for the purpose of improving and developing
          physical skills. However, use of the platform and
          participation in the suggested exercises involve risks
          inherent in physical activities, including, but not limited
          to, physical injury, fatigue or exhaustion. Users assume
          full responsibility for their participation in any activity
          or exercise proposed on the platform. Before beginning any
          physical training program, it is recommended that you
          consult a medical professional or certified trainer to
          ensure that the exercises are appropriate for your current
          physical condition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Flickzit is not liable for any injury, damage or harm,
          direct or indirect, arising from the use of the platform or
          the suggested exercises and activities. The platform is
          provided “as is,” with no warranties of any kind as to the
          accuracy, suitability or expected results of the exercises
          provided. Flickzit does not guarantee that the exercises
          will be suitable for all users or that the content will meet
          the specific objectives of the exercises. Each user's
          results may vary depending on a variety of factors,
          including physical condition and level of personal
          commitment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Flickzit also disclaims any responsibility for service
          interruptions, technical errors, loss of data or any other
          issues that may affect the availability or functionality of
          the platform. Users must ensure that their device and
          internet connection are adequate to access and use the
          platform. In no event shall Flickzit be liable for indirect,
          special, incidental or consequential damages resulting from
          the use or inability to use the platform, even if Flickzit
          has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        </p>
        <p>
          You agree that any decision to use the content provided by
          Flickzit, including physical exercises, is at your own risk.
          Further, Flickzit shall not be liable for any acts or
          omissions of third parties, including problems with payment
          processors or associated third party services, used to
          manage subscriptions. The user assumes responsibility for
          verifying the suitability and safe use of any equipment or
          physical environment necessary to perform the recommended
          exercises.

        <h3>18. TERMINATION</h3>
        <p>
          Both the user and Flickzit acknowledge that failure to
          comply with these terms and conditions may result in
          termination of the agreement between both parties.
        </p>
        <p>
          - <strong>In case of non-compliance by the user:</strong> If
          the user fails to comply with any of the terms set forth in
          these terms and conditions, Flickzit reserves the right to
          unilaterally terminate the user's access to and use of the
          platform. Flickzit may take this action without prior
          notice, and the User will automatically lose all rights to
          access and use the platform. Furthermore, Flickzit shall not
          be liable for any loss of data or information associated
          with the user's account.
        </p>
        <p>
          - <strong>In case of non-compliance by Flickzit:</strong> If
          Flickzit fails to comply with its obligations under the
          agreed terms and conditions, the User shall be entitled to
          terminate the agreement and stop using the platform. The
          user shall notify Flickzit in writing of the breach and
          allow a reasonable time for Flickzit to remedy the
          situation. If Flickzit does not remedy the breach within the
          set period, the user may proceed with the termination of the
          agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
          Termination of the agreement shall not release either party
          from any obligations and liabilities that have arisen prior
          to the date of termination.
        </p>
        <p>
          Continued use of the platform after termination of the
          agreement by either party shall imply acceptance of the
          conditions set forth in the terms and conditions in effect
          at that time.

          You acknowledge and agree that any dispute, claim, or
          controversy arising out of or relating to these terms and
          conditions, whether for breach, termination, performance,
          interpretation, or validity hereof, as well as your use of
          the platform as a user, shall preferably be resolved by
          binding arbitration between Flickzit and you. However, both
          parties retain the right to bring individual claims in a
          court of competent jurisdiction if deemed necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the event of any dispute arising in connection with your
          use of the platform as a user, or breach of these terms and
          conditions, both parties agree to seek resolution through an
          arbitration process. This process will be conducted before a
          recognized and respected arbitration entity, selected by
          mutual agreement of both parties and following the
          applicable commercial arbitration rules.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, the user agrees, to the extent permitted by
          applicable law, not to initiate, join, or participate in
          class action lawsuits associated with any claim, dispute, or
          controversy that may arise in connection with the use of the
          platform as a user. This commitment seeks to promote a more
          agile and personalized resolution of any conflict, favoring
          arbitration and individual legal actions over class actions.
